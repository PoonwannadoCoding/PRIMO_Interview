**Merge Function**

For the logic and explanation it's all located in ./src./merge.ts file already

1. Need to compile the .ts file first by

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

2. In case you want to run the merge.ts on your own use command
   ```
   node ./dist/merge.js
   ```
3. The unit test file is in the directory test. In order to run the unit test use command
   ```
   npm test
   ```
